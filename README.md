I am currently working on a python implementation of the split and merge algorithm described in [1] and [2] using the Quadtree and Region Adjacency Graph data structures. 
I finished implementing the splitting and merging steps starting from an arbitrary quadtree level, but I did not implement the grouping of nodes belonging to different levels of the quadtree yet.

Sample output from the current version of the program:
